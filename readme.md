# Personal Learnings
* I am a visual learner and writing out the design of a site helps me.

* The value of plugins and tools can be very helpful in identifying underlying issues in code or assist in making a website consistent across many browsers. The use of GULP makes a huge difference in how I work.

* My understanding of areas such as flexbox and JQuery are improving as I practice and test more often.

* Using SASS is a marked improvement from using vanilla CSS. By modularizing my css, it has improved my organization and allows me to review my code easier.
